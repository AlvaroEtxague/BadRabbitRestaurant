# BadRabbitRestaurant

## 1. UX

## About:

- This is a web page for the Bad Rabbit restaurant.
- They specialize in meat signature dishes and are located in the city centre of Dublin, Ireland.

## Business Goals

### Why are we so special:

- We are a unique place for meat lovers with a diverse menu in a great social location.
- We would like to improve our online presence by having a website that allows simple navigation and where users can make a reservation.

### Why would a user want this:

- The client asked to keep simplicity and focus on giving users valuable content only.

- Previously, users left average or bad online reviews due to the restaurant having an outdated UI and too much useless information on the web.

- Also, there was no functionality built in for online bookings and customers often called the restaurant to make reservations.

- The new Contact Us page contains a message us, call us as well as a google maps link to our address as many customers had issues finding our restaurant in the past because we are located in a small street in a very busy area of the city centre.

- We are offering users a full online menu where they can see our signature dishes before coming to the restaurant.

- In other words, we are giving users an easy way to make a reservation, a clear picture of our menu and 3 main ways of communication plus our social media information.

### User Stories:

- As a restaurant user I want to:
  - be able to navigate through the website content with fluidity
  - be able to view the menu
  - be able to book a table online
  - be able to contact the restaurant

### Tech:

- I wanted to present a minimalist approach in this page while also giving users the most relevant information about the restaurant.

- The website will be fully responsive and should follow a "mobile first" approach.

- Users will be presented with a Home, Menu and Contact Us pages as well as a Bookings page where they can complete a simple form and make a reservation through the website.

- Social media links will be available in the footer.
