## Strategy:

## About:

This is a web page for the Bad Rabbit restaurant.
They specialize in meat signature dishes and are located in the city centre of Dublin, Ireland.

## Business Goals

### Why are we so special:

We are a unique place for meat lovers with a diverse menu in a great social location.
We would like to improve our online presence by having a website that allows simple navigation and where users can make a reservation.

### Tech:

I wanted to present a minimalist approach in this page while also giving users the most relevant information about the restaurant.

The website will be fully responsive and should follow a "mobile first" approach.

Users will be presented with a Home, Menu and Contact Us pages as well as a Bookings page where they can complete a simple form and make a reservation through the website.

Social media links will be available in the footer.

### Why would a user want this:

The client asked to keep simplicity and focus on giving users valuable content only.

Previously, users left average or bad online reviews due to the restaurant having an outdated UI and too much useless information on the web.

Also, there was no functionality built in for online bookings and customers often called the restaurant to make reservations.

The new Contact Us page contains a message us, call us as well as a google maps link to our address as many customers had issues finding our restaurant in the past because we are located in a small street in a very busy area of the city centre.

We are offering users a full online menu where they can see our signature dishes before coming to the restaurant.

In other words, we are giving users an easy way to make a reservation, a clear picture of our menu and 3 main ways of communication plus our social media information.
